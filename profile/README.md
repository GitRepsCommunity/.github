# Welcome to the GitReps Community!

## About
This open source project is designed to help new grads build real-world experience and get support finding software engineering jobs.
Our goal is to connect members with mentors who are seasoned software engineers and provide a safe low-pressure environment to
sharpen technical and collaboration skills.

The [platform project](https://github.com/orgs/GitRepsCommunity/projects/1) is the focus of our work. The idea for the platform is
to collect data about members' contributions to the project and then transform that data into a compelling story for potential
employers.

## How do I get started?
The first step is to get access to our Discord server and this GitHub org. 

To request access just email join@gitreps.com and say something like:
> Hi my name is _,
> 
> I want to join the GitReps community! My GitHub username is _.
