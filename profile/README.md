# Welcome to the GitReps Community!

## About
This open source project is designed to help new grads build real-world experience and get support finding software engineering jobs.
Our goal is to connect members with mentors who are seasoned software engineers and provide a safe low-pressure environment to
sharpen technical and collaboration skills.

The [platform project](https://github.com/orgs/GitRepsCommunity/projects/1) is the focus of our work. The idea for the platform is
to collect data about members' contributions to the project and then transform that data into a compelling story for potential
employers.

## How do I get started?
The first step is to get access to our Discord server and this GitHub org. 

To request access just email join@gitreps.com and say something like:
> Hi my name is _,
> 
> I want to join the GitReps community! My GitHub username is _.

## Guidelines for Contributing

**_IMPORTANT: The way you contribute will be directly reflected in your developer story (see below). Healthy contributions will impress potential employers, but the opposite is true as well!_**

Here are a few guidelines to get the most out of contributing to the project.

* **Over communicate**. Ask questions, make suggestions, be social and encourage others.
* **Show your work**. Open a [draft pull request](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) after making your first commit. Make comments describing what you’re doing and why. Ask for feedback and help.
* **Stay focused**. Limit the number of issues you have in progress. Try to complete an issue before starting another.

## Developer Story

Your developer story helps people understand what it’s like working with you. How effective are you at getting work done? What’s the quality of code you write? Are you collaborative and enjoyable to work with? Do you take the initiative and own your work?

There are a few standard metrics and insights we can use to get an accurate and wholistic picture of a developer’s capabilities.

### Metrics
* **Batch size**: the lines of code changed in a given pull request.
* **Throughput**: the number of pull requests you get through over a selected period of time.
* **Flow efficiency**: the percentage of days when the issue was actively worked on compared to its whole lifetime.
* **Issue cycle time**: the amount of time work has spent in the ‘in progress’ status.
* **PR cycle time**
    * Time in progress — from the first commit or from when the pull request is opened, whichever happens first to the first review request.
    * Time in review — from the first review request to the final approval.
    * Time to merge — from the final approval to once the pull request is merged.

### Insights
* What technologies did this person work on?
  * Number of lines by language
* What projects did this person work on?
  * Number of issues by project
* How much impact did they have on the project, and how well did the project go?
  * % issues assigned by project
* Are they reviewing enough pull requests?
  * Number of PR reviews
  * Number of PR review comments
* Who have they worked with the most?
* How well do they communicate?
  * Length of PR descriptions
  * Media in PR descriptions
  * Sentiment of comments
